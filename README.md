# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis ##

The school board asked our supervisor to eliminate the data of the "Thomas High School" of the ninth grade since the results seem altered and cannot give a reliable result of the global results. In this sense, the objective was to eliminate said data and redo the general analysis.

## Results ##

The total sum of students is 39,170. When removing the ninth grade students from Thomas High School, the total sum of students is 38,709. That is, only 1.17% was eliminated from the total number of students analyzed.

In this sense, the figures did not have an important change in relation to the performance in mathematics and reading of the total number of schools.

In figure 1 we can see the result removing the data.

Figure 2 shows how the only change is in the ninth grade at Thomas High School.

However, where we see a greater change in math and reading scores is in Scores by school size, where performance drops.
